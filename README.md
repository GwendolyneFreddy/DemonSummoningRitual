## <a name="intro" id="intro"></a>Overview

This mod adds a demon summoning ritual book, which belongs to the master-wizard Tolgerias (Planar Sphere/Slums). You can summon different random demons with it (nabassu/glabrezu/cornugon/pit fiend/balor).

:warning: For the challenge I made Tolgerias somewhat harder to kill! &#128521;

Note: This item can't be used by good aligned characters. 

Have fun using it, I had some making it!


<hr>


## <a name="compat" id="compat"></a>Compatibility

This is a WeiDU mod, and therefore should be compatible with all WeiDU mods. If you encounter any bugs, please <a href="">report them on the forum!</a><br>

## <a name="installation" id="installation"></a>Installation

#### Notes

*If you've previously installed the mod, remove it before extracting the new version. To do this, run **`setup-dsr.exe`**, un-install all previously installed main component and delete the :file_folder: **dsr** folder.*

*When installing or un-installing, **do not close the DOS window** by clicking on the **X** button! Instead, press the **Enter** key whenever instructed to do so.*

*__Disable any antivirus__ or other memory-resident software before installing this or any other mod. Some (particularly avast and Norton!) have a tendency to report false positives with mod activity, resulting in failed installs.*

## 

#### Enhanced Editions Note

The Enhanced Editions are actively supported games. Please note that every patch update will wipe your current mod setup! If in the middle of a modded game you might want to delay the patch update (if possible) as even after reinstalling the mods, you might not be able to continue with your old savegames. Alternatively, copy the whole game's folder into a new one that can be modded and will stay untouched by game patches. It is important that you install the mod to the language version you are playing the game in. Otherwise, the dialogues of the mod will not show but give error messages.

## 

#### Windows

The Demon Summoning Ritual mod for Windows is distributed as an extractable compressed archive and includes a WeiDU installer.

Extract the contents of the mod archive into the folder of the game you wish to modify (*the folder which contains the "CHITIN.KEY" file*), using <a href="http://www.7-zip.org/download.html">7zip</a>, <a href="http://www.rarlab.com/download.htm">WinRAR</a>, or another file compression utility that handles .zip files. On successful extraction, there should be a :file_folder: dsr folder and a setup-dsr.exe file in your game folder. To install, simply double-click **`setup-dsr.exe`** and follow the instructions on screen.

Run **`setup-dsr.exe`** in your game folder to reinstall, un-install or otherwise change the components settings.

## 

#### Mac OS X

The Demon Summoning Ritual mod for Mac OS X is distributed is distributed in the same compressed archive and includes a WeiDU installer.

First, extract the files from the archive into your game directory. On successful extraction, there should be a :file_folder: dsr folder, setup-dsr and setup-dsr.command files in your game folder. To install, simply double-click **`setup-dsr.command`** and follow the instructions on screen.

Run **`setup-dsr.command`** in your game folder to reinstall, un-install or otherwise change the components settings.

## 

#### Linux

The Demon Summoning Ritual mod for Linux is distributed in the same compressed archive and does not include a WeiDU installer.

Extract the contents of the mod to the folder of the game you wish to modify.

Download the latest version of WeiDU for Linux from <a href="https://github.com/WeiDUorg/weidu/releases">WeiDU.org</a> and copy weidU and weinstall to /usr/bin. Following that, open a terminal, **cd** to your game installation directory, run tolower and answer 'Y' to both queries. You can avoid running the second option (linux.ini) if you've already ran it once in the same directory. To save time, the archive is already tolowered, so there's no need to run the first option (lowercasing file names) either if you've extracted only this mod since the last time you lowercased file names. If you're unsure, running tolower and choosing both options is the safe bet.

To install, run **`weinstall setup-dsr`** in your game folder. Then run **`wine BGMain.exe`** and start playing.

## 

#### Note for Complete Un-installation

In addition to the methods above for removing individual components, you can completely un-install the mod using **`setup-dsr --uninstall`** at the command line to remove all components without wading through prompts.</br>
