Unholy Gate Opening Ritual Book (for BGII: Throne of Bhaal)

Contents: This is a demon summoning ritual book, which belongs to the master-wizard Tolgerias (Planar Sphere/Slums). You can summon different random demons with it (nabassu/glabrezu/cornugon/pit fiend/balor).

Warning: For the challenge I made Tolgerias somewhat harder to kill! :)

Note: This item can't be used by good aligned characters.

Have fun using it, I had some making it!
