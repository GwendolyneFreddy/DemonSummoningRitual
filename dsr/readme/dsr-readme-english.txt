Unholy Gate Opening Ritual Book (for BGII: Throne of Bhaal)

Contents: This is a demon summoning ritual book, which is in possession of the master wizard Tolgerias (Planar sphere/Slums). You can summon several types of demons (nabassu/glabrezu/cornugon/pit fiend/balor) with the manual, the choice is random.

Warning: For the challenge I made Tolgerias somewhat harder to kill! :)

Note: This item can't be used by good aligned characters.

Have fun using it, I had some making it!
